# 2020-01-18 Dep to Mod

Decided to convert from dep to mod and realized the code is too old to be reused (unlike Xephon-B).
Most code is very old, using pkg/errors and x/net/context ... All of my newer code has switched to gommon/errors long time ago.

So there is no need to keep existing code ... (any more) ...
