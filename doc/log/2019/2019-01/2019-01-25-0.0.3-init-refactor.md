# 2019-01-25 Init Refactor 0.3.0

This is the doc following [#69](https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-k/issues/69) to restart Xephon-K,
it's been a year ... Same as other refactor, go.ice, ayi, need to come up with a basic plan.

The rough plan for the refactor is the following:

- what has been done in xephon-k (supported backends, supported queries)
- new goals (likely most existing implementation will be abandoned)
  - need implementation in other languages, for practice other language, also the design is no longer limit to the implementation of one language
  - different scopes, embed, single node server, distributed
  - different model, time series with id, time series with tags, traces, common tabular analytical (column) store
- a initial embed implementation in Go, can reuse existing implementation (which have a lot of wrong optimization, i.e. pass pointer of slice ....)
  - can be used for sundial, or just collect my local machine metrics
  - might favor java or cpp cause at least the fist one won't cause me a day to setup dependency and compile things
